# License-Plate-Recognition-Using-Python-and-OpenCV

This Application uses Pytesseract Library of Python and OpenCV to detect license plate number from car images.
The program preprocesses the car image and detects the license plate of the car.
The image is cropped to display the license plate only.
Using Pytesseract the text (license plate number) of the car is read from the cropped image.
This license plate number is then displayed to the user.

To run the code, install python2 and libraries pytesseract and openCV.
